# Data Science as a Field Final Project
This final project consists of the below two .Rmd files, which demonstrates my ability to create a reproducible report showing the steps 
I completed in the data anlysis process of the NYPD Shooting Incident Data (Historic) and the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering
COVID-19 Time series summary datasets.

* Final_Project_1_NYPD_Shooting_Incident_Data.Rmd
* Final_Project_2_COVID19_Data.Rmd

# Steps
1. Download both R Markdown files listed above.
2. Open the R Markdown file in an R script editor (such as RStudio).
3. Install and load the below required R packages
4. Use the knit function to process the R Markdown file. This will execute the code chunks and create the final document in the specified format (e.g., HTML, PDF).

## Required R packages
`knitr`
`tidyverse`
`ggthemes`
`lubridate`
`tinytex`
